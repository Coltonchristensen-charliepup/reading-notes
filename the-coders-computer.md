## An IDE interface is an interface for mass storage devices, 
* in which the controller is integrated into the disk or CD-ROM drive. 
Although it really refers to a general technology,
 most people use the term to refer the ATA specification,
 which uses this technology.
 * Refer to ATAfor more information.
* You’ll use the “pwd” command all the time! It’s easy to get lost in your file structure,
 so knowing where you are is very useful

# What is a text editor?

* A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
What features should you look for in a text editor? I would say some
of the most important features are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them. You might find some other
features that are must-have’s, but I think these features are a good
start.
A great feature of any text editing software is code completion. Code
completion allows you to start typing, and the code completion
feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally
typed. This saves you time by providing a choice, rather than allowing
you to finish typing and possibly encounter typos.
Also, some code completion includes the closing of tags when you
open them, or the closing of brackets when you open them, or the
closing of quotation marks when you open them, thus making sure
you’re always writing your code.
Another nice feature is being able to write your HTML and CSS more
efficiently. There is a kind of shorthand language called Emmet that
can help. Emmet will speed up your code writing faster than you can
imagine. Some text editors come with Emmet built right in, or
Emmet can be added by the means of an extension.
Another feature you should definitely look into is called syntax
highlighting. Syntax highlighting is a feature that takes the text you
type, and makes it more noticeable by colorizing the text. Attributes
are a different color than elements. And elements are a different color
than copy. This makes it so much easier when you’re looking for an
error and you can’t find it. As well as making your text easier to read.
